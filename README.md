# fortran-fun
Fortran fun is a collaboration of files i made when i went to try fortran95 as my primary programming language, i decided i would try and go back to this and try again, hope you enjoy a trip back to the 50's when computers were barely a thing, and even if they were it took a shit ton of power and everything was written on paper.
