Fortran fun is a collaboration of files i made when i went to try fortran95 as my primary programming language, i decided i would try and go back to this and try again, hope you enjoy a trip back to the 50's when computers were barely a thing, and even if they were it took a shit ton of power and everything was written on paper.


```
compile and install = linux =

chmod +x ./install.sh ; ./install.sh 

! this will compile all the fortran files necessary

```
